## CVE: Not Just a Number, But a Map

CVE—Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures—is often mistaken for just another ID system.  
But as [Adam Shostack explains](https://shostack.org/blog/thoughts-on-cve/), its true value lies not in the number itself, but in its function as a stable knowledge concordance across disparate systems:

> “The value of CVE is not the number, but its ability to reliably cross-reference tools, databases, and vendor patches.”

In essence, CVE is like the **ISBN for cybersecurity**. It allows tools, vendors, researchers, and patching systems to align with one shared reference.

## A System We All Used, For Free

CVE has been maintained by MITRE, a U.S. government-funded nonprofit.  
And yet, the entire global security ecosystem has depended on this system for free:

- Enterprises
- Governments
- Open source communities
- Security vendors

CVE has operated as a **global public good**, without international funding, and with most contributions from unpaid researchers.

## The Collapse That Nearly Happened

In April 2025, MITRE's government contract for CVE operations nearly expired.  
A last-minute intervention from CISA granted an 11-month extension, but the future remains uncertain.

> We narrowly avoided the collapse of the system that powers vulnerability coordination worldwide.

The structural issue is clear: **CVE relies on a single nation's funding, despite global usage.** This concern has been highlighted in recent reports from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-funding-running-out-critical-cyber-vulnerability-database-manager-says-2025-04-15/), [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-extends-funding-to-ensure-no-lapse-in-critical-cve-services/), and [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/16/cve_program_funding_save/).

## What If There Were a Security Tax?

Imagine this:

> High-risk corporations contribute a small percentage of revenue to a public fund for security infrastructure.

This fund supports CVE-like systems, NGOs, bug bounty programs, and researcher compensation.

This idea is explored further [in this article](https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2023-04-18-strengthening-cybersecurity-through-government-ngos-and-bug-bounty-programs/).

While this model is not yet implemented anywhere, it reflects a growing recognition:

- Free-riding on security infrastructure is unsustainable
- Public security systems require collective funding
- Contributors deserve compensation, not just credit

Further discourse in [BankInfoSecurity](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/white-house-advisory-team-backs-cybersecurity-tax-incentives-a-24558) and [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/post/Framing-cybersecurity-as-a-tax-on-businesses) shows a shift toward incentives and reframing cybersecurity as a shared cost burden.

## It's Time to Pay for What We've Been Using

CVE wasn’t truly free.  
It ran on the unpaid labor of researchers, the infrastructure of nonprofits, and a single government’s budget.

Now, as that model falters, we need shared solutions:

- International funding models
- Industry co-funding
- Governmental cooperation
- Transparent compensation for contributors

Initiatives like [Common Good Cyber](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/funding-the-organizations-that-secure-the-internet) are beginning to pave the way. Their proposed structures—joint funding mechanisms, federated fundraising, and accelerator hubs—were highlighted at RSA Conference 2025, aiming to produce a global, multilateral support system.

This also aligns with public-private models advocated by [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/shared-responsibility-public-private-cooperation-cybersecurity).

> Security has felt like a free lunch.  
> But someone was always paying.

## 📌 TL;DR

- CVE is core public infrastructure for cybersecurity.
- It's been used globally but funded locally.
- It nearly collapsed in 2025 due to expiring contracts.
- We must build funding mechanisms for global security commons.

> The free lunch is over. We just didn’t notice who was footing the bill.
