&lt;p>We live in an era overflowing with information and surging technology.&lt;br>
AI mimics human speech, summarizes thought, and even predicts intent.&lt;br>
But amidst all this, something vital is slowly being forgotten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is:&lt;br>
&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Who thought of it first,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Who connected it,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Who gave it meaning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

a &lt;strong>collapse of network isolation&lt;/strong>,&lt;br>
and a &lt;strong>real-world regulatory failure&lt;/strong>—&lt;br>
that is not something AI can do.&lt;br>
It is a human act of context-building and&lt;br>
&lt;strong>a creative synthesis of law, policy, and technical risk.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Common Security Myths Developers Tell Themselves</title><link>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2025-04-01-common-security-myths-developers-tell-themselves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2025-04-01-common-security-myths-developers-tell-themselves/</guid><description>This article breaks down common developer security myths—responsibility deflection, overconfidence in technology, and security underestimation—and offers realistic countermeasures.</description></item><item><title>How to Block ECH and Mitigate DoH in Enterprise Networks</title><link>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2025-03-31-dnsmasq-ech-doh-block/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2025-03-31-dnsmasq-ech-doh-block/</guid><description>A hands-on guide using dnsmasq to filter SVCB and HTTPS records for disabling ECH and enforcing central DNS policies.

&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Overview of XML-RPC Vulnerabilities:&lt;/strong> As a lightweight remote call protocol for inter-system communication, XML-RPC is exposed to various threats such as RCE, XXE, DDoS, and privilege escalation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Notable Cases:&lt;/strong> NodeBB (CVE-2023-43187), Apache OFBiz (CVE-2020-9496), PHP XML-RPC (CVE-2005-1921), etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Real-World Use Cases:&lt;/strong> In addition to WordPress, Bugzilla, ManageEngine, and Apache OFBiz, XML-RPC is still used in some legacy systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mitigation Strategies:&lt;/strong> Disabling XML-RPC, enhancing input validation, reinforcing authentication systems, applying up-to-date security patches, implementing access control, and deploying WAFs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-xml-rpc">What is XML-RPC?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>XML-RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call)&lt;/strong> is a remote procedure call protocol that uses XML as its data format and HTTP as its transport mechanism.

&lt;p>Unlike companies like &lt;a href="https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2024-05-22-can-development-culture-influence-security-levels/#google-development-culture">Google&lt;/a> with an open and collaborative development culture, in some organizations that lack such culture, the quality of the code, including security levels, can be heavily influenced by the individual’s capability. In particular, developers who tend to write poor quality code, such as using the &lt;a href="https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2024-05-22-can-development-culture-influence-security-levels/#strcpy-function-risk">strcpy function&lt;/a>, can have their code quality and security levels assessed by utilizing &lt;a href="https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2024-05-22-can-development-culture-influence-security-levels/#static-analysis-tools">static analysis tools&lt;/a> (Joern, CodeQL, etc.) with &lt;a href="https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2024-05-22-can-development-culture-influence-security-levels/#custom-rule-examples">custom rules&lt;/a>. As a result, even in situations where the development culture is lacking, code quality and security levels can be improved, leading to the production of good-quality code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bypassing citrix policy is not a vulnerability, but it can be a violation of the law</title><link>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2023-04-27-bypassing-citrix-policy-is-not-a-vulnerability-but-it-can-be-a-violation-of-the-law/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2023-04-27-bypassing-citrix-policy-is-not-a-vulnerability-but-it-can-be-a-violation-of-the-law/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="bypassing-citrix-policy-is-not-a-vulnerability-but-a-legal-violation">Bypassing Citrix Policy is Not a Vulnerability but a Legal Violation&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Based on discussions with Citrix through &lt;a href="https://kb.cert.org/vince/comm/case/1022/">VINCE&lt;/a> from cert.org, it was concluded that this is not classified as a vulnerability because it requires administrative privileges. Therefore, I can share this information without security concerns. However, for security reasons, I do not recommend using Xendesktop (VDI) in special environments such as logically isolated or closed networks. If VDI must be used in such environments, please ensure that administrator privileges are removed and security-specific software is installed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Strengthening cybersecurity through government ngos and bug bounty programs</title><link>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2023-04-18-strengthening-cybersecurity-through-government-ngos-and-bug-bounty-programs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://windshock.github.io/en/post/2023-04-18-strengthening-cybersecurity-through-government-ngos-and-bug-bounty-programs/</guid><description>&lt;p>﻿

&lt;p>The Google Security Team proposed to the Chrome development team to remove the &lt;a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=898081">XSSAudit feature&lt;/a>. Although the only rationale provided was that the feature could be bypassed (as argued in a paper by &lt;a href="mailto:evn@google.com">evn@google.com&lt;/a>), it initially seemed unlikely that removal would proceed. However, it was ultimately decided that the feature would be completely eliminated in Chrome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main point of the &lt;a href="https://windshock.github.io/pdf/p1709-lekiesA.pdf">paper&lt;/a> is that bypass methods using targets within new JavaScript frameworks are difficult to defend against. Therefore, it proposes a shift from the existing mitigation approach (the xssaudit filter) to an isolation/prevention method, namely Content Security Policy (CSP).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://windshock.github.io/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://windshock.github.io/en/about/</guid><description>Security automation and vulnerability analysis expert.</description></item></channel></rss>
