Generate a slides.txt file that matches subtitle timing to slide images for FFmpeg.

Context:
- You are given:
  - A presentation exported to sequential slide images (1.png, 2.png, ..., n.png)
  - An audio narration file (e.g., audio.mp3)
  - A subtitle file (e.g., subtitles.srt) aligned to the audio
- There are n slide images (e.g., 12 total)

Your task:
1. Divide the full subtitle transcript evenly across all n slides **in order**.
2. Use the subtitle timestamps to determine the **duration for each slide**, based on which subtitles belong to that slide.
3. Sum the subtitle durations for each slide and assign it as duration in slides.txt.
4. Ensure that the **sum of all durations equals the total audio duration**.
5. **Repeat the final slide once more** at the end to allow for smooth outro.

Expected output format:
file '1.png'
duration 83
file '2.png'
duration 77
...
file '12.png'
duration 40
file '12.png'

Do not summarize. Output only the slides.txt content in plain text.
